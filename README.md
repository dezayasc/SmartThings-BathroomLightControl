SmartThings-BathroomLightControl
================================

SmartThings app to control bathroom lights based on motion / humidity <br />
Version 1.0.1

An app for SmartThings that will turn on a bathroom light based on motion, start a timer <br />
and turn the light off after motion has stopped for a period of time (5 minutes by default); however <br />
adjust the timer if it appears that humidity is rising in the room (ie: Shower in use). <br />

1. Login at <a href=http://graph.api.smartthings.com>http://graph.api.smartthings.com</a>

5. When a new app template opens in the IDE, replace the contents with that in the .groovy file here
6. Click the blue "Save" button above the editor window.
7. Click the "Publish" button next to it and select "For Me". You have now self-published your SmartApp.
8. Open SmartThings mobile app on iPhone or Android and go to the Dashboard.
